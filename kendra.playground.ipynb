Working with TekChoice, we implemented Amazon Connect outbound campaigns in less than 3 months. This fast, comprehensive implementation enabled us to continue our weekly member outreach after we learned that support was ending for our previous system. With Amazon outbound campaigns using ML-powered answering machine detection, we can verify if a member was contacted by seeing if a call is answered by a person, ended in a voicemail, or received no answer. We also use natural language processing capabilities of Amazon Connect to make automated conversations sound more lifelike and create an immersive, natural telephone banking experience for our members.”\\nCarla Lambrecht, Chief Information Officer - Scott Credit Union\\nFAQs\\nQ: How can I learn more about Amazon Connect?\\nFor more information, see Amazon Connect.\\nQ: How much does Amazon Connect outbound campaigns cost?\\n\\nFor outbound campaigns pricing information, see Amazon Connect pricing.\\nQ: How does Amazon Connect outbound campaigns support compliance?\\n\\nOutbound campaigns provides native Amazon Connect features to support local compliance regulations out of the box. Use do-not-call lists to prevent calling customers, and set “quiet time” controls, based on time of day, day of week, or holiday, when you want to avoid calling customers. Configure the maximum call attempts, and speed up time to connect a customer to an agent by disabling answering machine detection.\\nQ: What metrics are available in Amazon Connect outbound campaigns to track performance?\\n\\nOutbound campaigns provides both real-time and historical metrics to analyze campaign performance for voice, SMS, and email in the Amazon Connect analytics dashboard. Contact center managers can track completion percentage, communications sent, and calls answered or messages opened by customers. Voice-specific metrics include contact completion percentage, number of agents active, number of agents available, real-time predictive dial rate, average time to connect to an agent, and average call handle times. Customers can create metrics to calculate the time to connect a customer to an agent per call, by campaign, and by time period. Email-specific metrics include open and click rates. Contact center managers can drill in from the campaign summary metrics to analyze performance of routing profiles, queues, and individual agents. Historical metrics for completed campaigns, which contain the complete set of metrics included in the real-time set, are available for analysis and export from the Amazon Connect UI. These historical metrics can be filtered by channel (for voice, SMS, and email), agent queue (only for voice at launch since agents don’t send SMS and emails), agent routing profile (only for voice at launch since agents don’t send SMS and emails), and time period.\\nQ: Can Amazon Connect outbound campaigns integrate with other contact center products?\\n\\nNative to Amazon Connect, outbound campaigns will work only with your Amazon Connect cloud contact center.\\nRegions available: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Europe (London), Canada (Central).\\nCountries available for voice calling: Outbound campaign calls can be made to customers in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.\\nNote: You may use Amazon Connect outbound campaigns to make campaign calls to customers within the originating region.

       "  'Content': \"Use service-linked roles for Amazon Connect\\n\\nWhat are service-linked roles (SLR) and why are they important?\\nAmazon Connect uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to an Amazon Connect instance.\\nService-linked roles are predefined by Amazon Connect and include all the permissions that Amazon Connect requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.\\nYou need to enable service-linked roles so you can use new features in Amazon Connect, such as tagging support, the new user interface in User management and Routing profiles, and queues with CloudTrail support.\\nFor information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.\\nService-linked role permissions for Amazon Connect\\nAmazon Connect uses the service-linked role with the prefix AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect_unique-id – Grants Amazon Connect permission to access AWS resources on your behalf.\\nThe AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:\\nconnect.amazonaws.com\\nThe role permissions policy allows Amazon Connect to complete the following actions on the specified resources. As you enable additional features in Amazon Connect, additional permissions are added for the service-linked role to access the resources associated with those features:\\nAction: all Amazon Connect actions, connect:*, on all Amazon Connect resources.\\nAction: Amazon S3 s3:GetObject, s3:GetObjectAcl, s3:PutObject, s3:PutObjectAcl, s3:DeleteObject, s3:GetBucketLocation, and GetBucketAcl for the S3 bucket specified for recorded conversations.\\nIt also grants s3:PutObject, s3:PutObjectAcl, and s3:GetObjectAcl to the bucket specified for exported reports.\\nAction: Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nprofile:SearchProfiles\\nprofile:CreateProfile\\nprofile:UpdateProfile\\nprofile:AddProfileKey\\nprofile:ListProfileObjects\\nprofile:ListAccountIntegrations\\nprofile:ListProfileObjectTypeTemplates\\nprofile:GetProfileObjectTypeTemplate\\nprofile:ListProfileObjectTypes\\nprofile:GetProfileObjectType\\nto use your default Customer Profiles domain (including profiles and all object-types in domain) with the Amazon Connect flows and agent experience applications.\\nAction: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose firehose:DescribeDeliveryStream and firehose:PutRecord, and firehose:PutRecordBatch for the delivery stream defined for agent event streams and contact records.\\nAction: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams kinesis:PutRecord, kinesis:PutRecords, and kinesis:DescribeStream for the stream specified for agent event streams and contact records.\\nAction: Amazon Lex lex:PostContent for the bots added to your instance.\\nAction: Amazon Lex lex:ListBots, lex:ListBotAliases for all bots created in the account across all Regions.\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Logs logs:CreateLogStream, logs:DescribeLogStreams, and logs:PutLogEvents to the CloudWatch Logs group specified for flow logging.\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Metrics cloudwatch:PutMetricData to publish Amazon Connect usage metrics for an instance to your account.\\nAction: Amazon Connect Voice-ID voiceid:* for the Voice ID domains associated with your instance.\\nAction: EventBridge events:PutRule and events:PutTargets for the Amazon Connect managed EventBridge rule for publishing CTR records for your associated Voice ID domains.\\nAction: outbound campaigns\\nconnect-campaigns:CreateCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:DeleteCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:DescribeCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateCampaignName\\nconnect-campaigns:GetCampaignState\\nconnect-campaigns:GetCampaignStateBatch\\nconnect-campaigns:ListCampaigns\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateOutboundCallConfig\\nconnect-campaigns:UpdateDialerConfig\\nconnect-campaigns:PauseCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:ResumeCampaign\\nconnect-campaigns:StopCampaign for all operations related to outbound campaigns.\\nYou must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role permissions in the IAM User Guide.\\nCreate a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\nYou don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you.\\nIf you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create a new instance in Amazon Connect, Amazon Connect creates the service-linked role for you again.\\nYou can also use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the Amazon Connect - Full access use case. In the IAM CLI or the IAM API, create a service-linked role with the connect.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to create the role again.\\nFor instances created before October 2018\\nIf your Amazon Connect instance was created before October 2018, you don't have service-linked roles set up. To create a service-linked role, on the Account overview page, choose Create service-linked role, as shown in the following image.\\nFor a list of the IAM permissions required to create the service-linked role, see Overview page in the Required permissions for using custom IAM policies to manage access to the Amazon Connect console topic.\\nEdit a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\nAmazon Connect does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\nChecking a service-linked role has permissions for Amazon Lex\\nOn the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles.\\nChoose the name of the role to modify.\\nDelete a service-linked role for Amazon Connect\\nYou don't need to manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonConnect prefixed role. When you delete your Amazon Connect instance in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Connect cleans up the resources and deletes the service-linked role for you.\\nSupported Regions for Amazon Connect service-linked roles\\nAmazon Connect supports using service-linked roles in all of the regions where the service is available.

       "  'Content': \"Standard identifiers\\n\\nStandard identifiers allow you to set attributes on the key. Decide which identifiers to use based on how you want the data to be ingested in the profiles. For example, you mark phone number with the identifier PROFILE. This means phone number is to be treated as unique identifier. If Customer Profiles gets two contacts with the same phone number, the contacts are going to be merged into a single profile.\\nIdentifier name Description\\nUNIQUE\\nThis identifier must be specified by exactly one index for each object type. This key is used to uniquely identify objects of the object type for either fetching them or if needed update a submitted object at a later date.\\nAll the fields that make up the UNIQUE keys are required to be specified when submitting a new object or it is rejected.\\nPROFILE\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies a profile. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any profile that has this key associated with it.\\nIf a profile is found, then the object is assigned to that profile.\\nIf more than one profile is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify a profile should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nLOOKUP_ONLY\\nThis identifier indicates the key is not stored after ingesting the object. The key is only to be used for determining the profile during ingestion.\\nThe key value is not associated with the profile during ingestion, which means it can't be used to allow searching for it or matching later ingested objects to the same key.\\nNEW_ONLY\\nIf the profile does not already exist before the object is ingested, the key is associated with the profile. Otherwise the key is only used for matching objects to profiles.\\nSECONDARY\\nDuring the matching of an object to a profile, Customer Profiles first looks up all PROFILE keys that do not have the SECONDARY identifier. These are considered first. SECONDARY keys are only considered if no matching profile is found using these keys.\\nASSET\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an asset. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any asset that has this key associated with it.\\nIf an asset is found, then the object is assigned to that asset.\\nIf more than one asset is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an asset should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nORDER\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies an order. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any order that has this key associated with it.\\nIf an order is found, then the object is assigned to that order.\\nIf more than one order is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify an order should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\\nCASE\\nThis identifier means that this key uniquely identifies a case. When this identifier is specified, it means that during ingestion, Customer Profiles looks for any case that has this key associated with it.\\nIf a case is found, then the object is assigned to that case.\\nIf more than one case is found when searching for this key, the match is rejected. (Only keys that uniquely identify a case should be used as unique keys except for special circumstances.)\"},\n",

       "  'Content': \"How Amazon Connect works with IAM\\n\\nBefore you use IAM to manage access to Amazon Connect, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with Amazon Connect. To get a high-level view of how Amazon Connect and other AWS services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.\\nTopics\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAmazon Connect identity-based policies\\nWith IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon Connect supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.\\nActions\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.\\nInclude actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.\\nPolicy actions in Amazon Connect use the following prefix before the action: connect:. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon Connect defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.\\nTo specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:\\n'Action': [\\n      'connect:action1',\\n      'connect:action2'\\nYou can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:\\n'Action': 'connect:Describe*'\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect actions, Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nResources\\nAmazon Connect supports resource-level permissions (specifying a resource ARN in an IAM policy). Following is a list of Amazon Connect resources:\\nInstance\\nContact\\nUser\\nRouting profile\\nSecurity profile\\nHierarchy group\\nQueue\\nFlow\\nHours of operation\\nPhone number\\nTask templates\\nCustomer profile domain\\nCustomer profile object type\\nOutbound campaigns\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.\\nFor actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.\\n'Resource': '*'\\nThe Amazon Connect instance resource has the following ARN:\\narn:$Partition:connect:$Region:$Account:instance/$InstanceId\\nFor more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.\\nFor example, to specify the i-1234567890abcdef0 instance in your statement, use the following ARN:\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0'\\nTo specify all instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard (*):\\n'Resource': 'arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*'\\nSome Amazon Connect actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard (*).\\n'Resource': '*'\\nMany Amazon Connect; API actions involve multiple resources. For example,\\nTo specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.\\n'Resource': [\\n      'resource1',\\n      'resource2'\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect resource types and their ARNs, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect. The same article explains with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource.\\nCondition keys\\nAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.\\nThe Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can create conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.\\nIf you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.\\nYou can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM policy elements: variables and tags in the IAM User Guide.\\nAWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAmazon Connect defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.\\nAll Amazon EC2 actions support the aws:RequestedRegion and ec2:Region condition keys. For more information, see Example: Restricting Access to a Specific Region.\\nTo see a list of Amazon Connect condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Connect.\\nExamples\\nTo view examples of Amazon Connect identity-based policies, see Amazon Connect identity-based policy examples.\\nAuthorization based on Amazon Connect tags\\nYou can attach tags to Amazon Connect resources or pass tags in a request to Amazon Connect. To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the connect:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.\\nTo view an example identity-based policy for limiting access to a resource based on the tags on that resource, see Describe and update Amazon Connect users based on tags.\\nAmazon Connect IAM roles\\nAn IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.\\nUsing temporary credentials with Amazon Connect\\nYou can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken.\\nAmazon Connect supports using temporary credentials.\\nService-linked roles\\nService-linked roles allow AWS services to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.\\nAmazon Connect supports service-linked roles. For details about creating or managing Amazon Connect service-linked roles, see Use service-linked roles for Amazon Connect.\\nChoosing an IAM role in Amazon Connect\\nWhen you create a resource in Amazon Connect, you must choose a role to allow Amazon Connect to access Amazon EC2 on your behalf. If you have previously created a service role or service-linked role, then Amazon Connect provides you with a list of roles to choose from. It's important to choose a role that allows access to start and stop Amazon EC2 instances.\"},\n",

This makes it easier to manage flows and modules that are not in use or no longer needed. For example, flows used only during certain times of the year can be archived when not in use and then unarchived when needed. When a flow has been archived, you can then permanently delete the flow so it is no longer available within your list of flows. For more information, see Archive, restore, and delete flows and modules.\\nJuly 31, 2023\\nAdd notes to a block\\nFor more information, see Add notes to a block.\\nJuly 31, 2023\\nAdded permissions for using Wisdom page in console\\nFor more information, see Required permissions for using custom IAM policies to manage access to the Amazon Connect console.\\nJuly 28, 2023\\nStreamlined the left nav in the documentation\\nStreamlined the left navigation menu in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide to make it easier to navigate.\\nJuly 27, 2023\\nSchedule flexible days and shift activities based on shift length\\nYou can generate agent schedules that have the appropriate number of activities, such as breaks or meals, depending on the duration of the shift. The required number of breaks and meals are automatically placed in schedules that are compliant to various regional labor laws. You can generate agent schedules that include flexible days, that is, days that will be optionally scheduled if there's a need. Amazon Connect can automatically generate flexible schedules that are compliant to agent's contracts and regional labor laws, thereby saving time for schedulers. For more information, see Create shift profiles.\\nJuly 27, 2023\\nImport time off balances\\nYou can import time off balances for your users. You can also set the group allowance for time off by hour, for each calendar day, for specific time off activities. Amazon Connect uses the time off balance to automatically approve or decline time off requests based on the agent's available net balance and the group allowance for time off. For more information, see Import an agent's time off balance in a .csv file and Set group allowance for time off.\\nJuly 27, 2023\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles supports rule-based matching and merging\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles supports rule-based resolution to match and merge similar profiles into unified ones.

       "  'Content': \"CCP connectivity\\n\\nWhen an agent logs in, the CCP attempts to connect to the Amazon EC2 signaling endpoints listed in the AWS ipranges.json file, Amazon Connect for media, and CloudFront for web artifacts such as images. When the agent logs out or the browser is closed, endpoints are reselected when the agent next logs in. If a connection to Amazon EC2 or Amazon Connect fails, errors display on the CCP. If a connection to CloudFront fails, web elements such as buttons and icons, or even the page itself fails to load correctly.\\nOutbound calls\\nWhen an outbound call is placed, the event signal is sent to the Amazon EC2 endpoint, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call. Upon a successful dial attempt, the agent is bridged in, which anchors the call to the agent's Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also uses the anchor until the call is disconnected. Anchoring can help reduce PSTN latency.\\nInbound calls\\nWhen an inbound call is received, the call is anchored to an Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.\\nWhen an agent is available, the call is pushed through using a new Amazon EC2 connection to their browser and offered to the agent.\\nWhen the agent accepts the call and either the external device has been answered or the CCP determines it can receive a call, a connection to Amazon Connect is established for call media to the agent.\\nTransferred calls\\nWhen a call is transferred, the transfer event that signals to place an outbound call to the specified transfer destination is sent to Amazon EC2, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call.\\nWhen the call is connected, the agent is bridged in, anchoring the call to the agent's existing Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.\\nIf the agent hangs up after the call is bridged, the agent's connection to the call is terminated, but Amazon Connect hangs on to the call at the Amazon Connect anchor point until there is a far side disconnect. When the call is disconnected, contact records and associated recordings are generated and made available for the call.\\nMissed calls\\nIf the call is waiting on an agent, customer queue flow logic is used until an agent is available and the call has been successfully routed to that agent.\\nIf the agent does not accept the call, the agent moves into a Missed Call state and is unable to take calls until the agent, or a call center manager, changes their status to Available again. The caller does not hear ringing while the call is waiting for the agent, and continues to hold until connected with an agent as defined in the customer queue flow logic.\\nPanic logout\\nIf the browser window where the CCP is running is closed, the call remains connected, but opening the browser and logging back in will not allow you to re-establish the media connection. You are still able to transfer or end the call, but no audio path is established between the agent and caller.\"},\n",

       "  'Content': \"Using service-linked roles for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\n\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Customer Profiles. Service-linked roles are predefined by Customer Profiles and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.\\nA service-linked role makes setting up Amazon Connect Customer Profiles easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. Amazon Connect Customer Profiles defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Amazon Connect Customer Profiles can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.\\nFor information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-linked roles column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.\\nService-linked role permissions for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForProfile_unique-id which allows Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to access AWS services and resources on your behalf..\\nThe AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:\\nprofile.amazonaws.com\\nThe role permissions policy named CustomerProfilesServiceLinkedRolePolicy allows Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to complete the following actions on the specified resources:\\nAction: Amazon CloudWatch Metrics cloudwatch:PutMetricData to publish Amazon Connect usage metrics for an instance to your account.\\nAction: IAM iam:DeleteRole to delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role itself when associated Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain is deleted.\\nYou must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role permissions in the IAM User Guide.\\nCreating a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nYou don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create your first Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Customer Profiles creates the service-linked role for you. Note each Amazon Connect Customer Profiles domain requires a dedicated SLR in order for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to take actions for you.\\nImportant\\nThis service-linked role can appear in your account if you completed an action in another service that uses the features supported by this role. Also, if you were using the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service before June 8, 2023, when it began supporting service-linked roles, then Amazon Connect Customer Profiles created the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed role in your account. To learn more, see A new role appeared in my IAM account.\\nIf you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create your first Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain, Customer Profiles creates the service-linked role for you again.\\nEditing a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\nDeleting a service-linked role for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\\nYou don't need to manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed role. When you delete the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Customer Profiles cleans up the resources and deletes the service-linked role for you.\\nYou can also use the AWS CLI or the AWS API to manually delete the service-linked role. To do this, you must first manually clean up the resources for your service-linked role and then you can manually delete it.\\nNote\\nIf the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.\\nTo delete Amazon Connect Customer Profiles resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role\\nDelete the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles domain in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API.\\nTo manually delete the service-linked role using IAM\\nUse the AWS CLI or the AWS API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForProfile prefixed service-linked role. For more information, see Deleting a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.\\nSupported regions for Amazon Connect Customer Profiles service-linked roles\\nAmazon Connect Customer Profiles supports using service-linked roles in all of the regions where the service is available. For more information, see AWS regions and endpoints.\\nRegion name Region identity Support in Amazon Connect\\nUS East (N.

       "  'Content': \"Create an object type mapping\\n\\nAn object type mapping tells Customer Profiles how to ingest a specific type of data from a source application—such as Salesforce, Zendesk, or S3—into a unified standard profile object. You can then display data in that object (for example, customer address and email) to your agents using the Amazon Connect agent application.\\nThe object type mapping provides Customer Profiles with the following information:\\nHow data should be populated from the object and ingested into the standard profile object.\\nWhat fields should be indexed in the object and how those fields should then be used to assign objects of this type to a specific profile.\\nThere are two ways you can create an object type mapping:\\nUse the Amazon Connect console. The user interface makes data mapping features readily accessible. For example, you can add custom attributes, and define search and unique identifiers for contact models. No coding required!\\nUse the Customer Profiles API. For more information, see the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API Reference.\\nThis topic explains how to create a mapping using the Amazon Connect console.\\nCreate a data mapping using the Amazon Connect console\\nAmazon Connect provides a no-code experience for mapping customer data from homegrown and third-party applications with Amazon S3, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and Marketo.\\nTo create a data mapping, you define an object type mapping that describes what the custom profile object looks like. This mapping defines how fields from your data can be used to either populate fields in the standard profile or how they can be used to assign the data to a specific profile.\\nStep 1: Set up data mapping\\nOpen the Amazon Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/.\\nOn the instances page, choose the instance alias. The instance alias is also your instance name, which appears in your Amazon Connect URL. The following image shows the Amazon Connect virtual contact center instances page, with a box a box around the instance alias.\\nIn the navigation pane, choose Customer profiles, Data mappings.\\nChoose Create data mapping to get started.\\nAt the Set up data mapping page, in the Description section, add a name that will help you identify the source or purpose of this mapping. This is the meta-data of the object type.\\nIn the Data source section:\\nChoose where the data is coming from, such as Salesforce or Zendesk. Based on your selection, Amazon Connect automatically selects the available destinations based on the predefined template.\\nChoose the source object. This is used for you to build your unified profile.\\nIn the Mapping destination section, choose the data that you want to use to build your unified customer profile. This information can be surfaced to your flows and agents to personalize the interactions with contacts.\\nFor more information about supported mapping destinations, see About mapping destinations.\\nIn the Additional options section, you can choose when to opt out of creating new profiles, and how long to retain them. These options help you manage costs.\\nNote\\nBy default the domain retention period is 366 days. To change the retention period set on your domain, use the UpdateDomain API.\\nIf you chose a source other than S3, in the Establish a connection with application section, choose an existing Amazon AppFlow or Amazon EventBridge connection to connect your data, or create a new connection. You can create a new connection by entering details about your account for this data source.\\nAfter the connection is established, you will choose the objects that you want to ingest from your data source.\\nChoose Next.\\nStep 2: Map attributes\\nOn the Map type attributes page, you'll see the field mappings table filled with the predefined template, based on the mapping destination. For example, it's filled with customer, product, case, or order attributes. You can change the predefined template by choosing an attribute (such as AccountNumber) and then selecting a different destination, or enter one of your own custom attributes.\\nThe following image shows an example of the page filled with customer attributes from the template.\\nYou can remove what you don’t want populated in the customer profile, change the source, and add custom attributes.\\nThis mapping uses your data source to populate customer contact information, such as a phone number in the customer profile. It uses attributes from the standard profile template.\\nTip\\nIf you choose to add custom attributes, the destination will always have the prefix Attributes. added to it. This enables Amazon Connect to recognize that it is a custom attribute.\\nAgents can now view custom attributes in the Connect Agent Application under the Additional Information tab sorted in alphabetical order. You can create the name of your choice for each attribute that will be displayed to agents by using the following format: /^Attributes\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:[ _\\\\-]+[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$/\\nAll ingested custom attributes will be displayed in the Connect Agent Application. If you do not wish to show certain information to your agents, do not ingest custom attributes at this time.\\nStep 3: Specify identifiers\\nOn the Specify identifiers page, complete the following sections. Depending on what data you're mapping, it's possible not all of these will appear on your page.\\nNote\\nThe names _profileId, _orderId, _caseId, and _assetId are reserved for internal use. If you decide to use these names as one of your identifier names, they must be declared as LOOKUP_ONLY, which means our system will not save them to match with profiles, standard assets, standard orders, standard cases, or save them for searching your profile, asset, case, or order. If you would like these keys to be usable for searching and matching, you must rename your key. For more information on the LOOKUP_ONLY standard identifier, see Standard identifiers.\\nUnique identifier: You must have a unique identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. This identifier is also known as the unique key. Customer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other data source objects, and to index for search and update data.\\nThere can be only one unique identifier.\\nCustomer identifier: You must have at least one customer identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the profile key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to determine if the data case be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple customer identifiers.\\nTip\\nAgents can use any of these customer Identifiers in the Agent Workspace to find the profile that belongs to customer on the interaction.\\nProduct identifier: You must have at least one product identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the asset key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other customer product purchase data. It is also used to determine if the data can be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple product identifiers.\\nCase identifier: You must have at least one case identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the case key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other customer case data. It is also used to determine if the data can be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple case identifiers.\\nOrder identifier: You must have at least one order identifier for your data in order to avoid an error when it is ingested. The identifier is also known as the order key.\\nCustomer Profiles uses it to distinguish this data from other customer order data. It is also used to determine if the data can be associated to an existing profile or used to create a new profile by searching other profiles for this identifier.\\nYou can have multiple order identifiers.\\nAdditional search attributes - optional: You can choose attributes in your data source object that you want to index to be searchable. By default, all your identifiers are indexed.\\nData object timestamp: The data object timestamp is used to resolve profile conflicts when Identity Resolution is enabled for consolidating similar profiles. When two or more similar profiles have conflicting records, the records from the profile with the most recently updated timestamp will be used.\\nYou can choose an attribute in your object to reference for when your object was last updated.\\nStep 4: Review and create\\nAfter the data mapping is created, you can choose Add data source integration to use this object type.\"}]"

      "Amazon Connect runs on a SIP-only infrastructure through our carrier partners. However, the caller ID name can be delivered to your customers only if the call path across the public telephony network is all on SIP.

Depending on the country this will be up to 75% effective.\n",

      "You can set the caller ID number as follows:\n",
      "Call phone number block: Use this block in an Outbound whisper flow to initiate an outbound call to a customer and, optionally, specify a custom caller ID number that is displayed to call recipients.\n",
      "This block is useful when you have multiple telephone numbers used to make outbound calls, but want to consistently display the same company phone number for the caller ID for calls made from your contact center.\n",
      "You can also use this block with the Set contact attributes block to set the callback number dynamically. For example, you can display a certain caller ID number based on the customer's account type.\n",
      "Queue: If no caller ID number is specified in the Call phone number block, then the caller ID in the queue settings is used.\n",
      "Important\n",
      "Telecoms regulation limit the telephone numbers that can be used to make outbound calls in various countries. If you have set up a new number and you are not able to make outbound calls, it may be because you have configured a number that is not permitted to make outbound calls.

      "Using toll-free numbers for outbound communications have a number of limitations. For example, using a toll-free number to dial other toll-free numbers in the United States can result in the number being filtered, blocked, or not properly routed to the destination by carriers. Toll-free numbers may be terminated at a higher than expected rate. If you know you need to call toll-free numbers in the United States you must use DIDs to make the calls to be guaranteed call delivery.\n",
      "If you're using toll-free numbers outside of the US, refer to the Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide to see which countries support toll-free numbers as outbound.

      "In the UK and many other countries internationally, local dialing requires the addition of a 0 in front of the subscriber number. However, to use E.164 formatting, this 0 must be removed. A number such as 020 718 xxxxx in the UK would be formatted as +44 20 718 xxxxx. When you place calls from the CCP using Amazon Connect the CCP provides the correct formatting for numbers automatically.\n",

Contact center supervisors\\nmake the most of that time by reducing the average handle time of interactions, so that agents can\\nquickly address customer issues and move on to the next interaction.\\nThis approach has a broader impact on contact center key performance indicators such as the average\\nspeed of answer, average hold times, abandoned rates, etc. Supervisors must maintain a fine balance of\\nensuring high customer satisfaction and reducing the time it takes to address customer issues. At times,\\nagents must consult other parties to solve customer issues. Those other parties could involve external\\nvendors, internal colleagues, or supervisors.\\nAmazon Connect natively supports warm transfers, which involve putting the customer on hold as the\\nagent makes an introduction about the caller to another party. Then, the agent can conference all\\nparties together and pass the context of the call for a seamless customer experience. The agent can then\\nleave this interaction, and the other parties stay connected. This approach works great for high-touch\\ncustomer experiences.\\nHowever, some calls don’t need their context passed on to the receiving party. Agents and supervisors\\nwant to quickly transfer these calls and move on to the next interaction. This is also known as a cold\\ntransfer. In this post, I demonstrate cold transfers using the Amazon Connect Streams API. For more\\ninformation about customizing the contact control panel (CCP), see the Streams API GitHub repository.\\nThis post discusses the following cold transfer scenarios. In the first three scenarios, the agent is\\nconnecting multiple external parties. In the fourth and fifth scenarios, the agent is connecting an\\nexternal party to another queue or agent.\\nThe agent makes an outbound call and then makes another outbound call. The agent cold\\ntransfers the first call to the second call.\\nThe agent receives an incoming call and then makes an outbound call.

That contact\\nobject initially possesses two connections:\\nThe agent connection to the Connect instance\\nThe calling or called party.\\nWhen the agent makes another phone call to an external number or quick connects, Amazon Connect creates a new connection and adds it to the same contact object. Except for cold transfers to agent quick connects, the agent connection can then safely disconnect and the remaining two parties remain conferenced automatically. For a cold transfer to agent quick connects, the destination agent must accept the phone call. Otherwise, the call fails. In this post, I review a workaround.\\nSolution\\nIn a production environment, you can implement these API calls in a custom CCP. However, if you are looking for quick validation, you can also make these API calls directly from the console in the Developer Tools section of Amazon Connect supported browsers.\\nPrerequisites\\nBefore getting started with this walk through, you need the following resources in place:\\nAn AWS account\\nAmazon Connect Instance\\nA configured Amazon Connect contact center and agents\\n(Optional) Quick Connects for external, agents and queue transfers\\n(Optional) A Custom CCP\\nWhitelisted Integrated Application\\nConnecting multiple external parties (scenarios 1–3)\\nFor scenarios 1 through 3—where both parties are external, the solution is similar.

Replace the phone number “+1xxxxxxxxxx” with an actual destination phone number.\\nvar endpoint = connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber('+1xxxxxxxxxx');\\n \\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(endpoint, \\n                                                                success: function(data) \\n                                                                   alert('transfer success');\\n                                                                ,\\n                                                                failure: function(data) \\n                                                                   alert('transfer failed');\\n                                                                \\n                                                );\\nJavaScript\\nYou can use the agent snapshot again to verify that the third connection is connected.\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\nJavaScript\\nAfter that, obtain the agent connection of this contact object and destroy it.\\nYou can copy the contact object from the agent snapshot, or obtain it explicitly using the following method:\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\n \\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\nJavaScript\\nThis completes the cold transfer to external numbers, either through quick connect for external transfer or agent manually dialed the number.\\nConnecting to another queue (scenario 4)\\nIn Scenario 4, the agent makes an outbound call or receives an incoming call, and then cold transfers it to another queue using queue quick connect.\\nUse the Streams API to make the first outbound call:\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber('+1xxxxxxxxxx'),);\\nJavaScript\\nAt this time, you can use an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected.\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\nJavaScript\\nYou can quickly view all the quick connect endpoints for this agent:\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)console.log(data.endpoints);,failure:function());\\nJavaScript\\nFor this example, assume that the quick connect index for desired queue is 9:\\nVar quick;\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)quick=data.endpoints[9];,failure:function());\\n \\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(quick, \\n                                                                success: function(data) \\n                                                                   alert('transfer success');\\n                                                                ,\\n                                                                failure: function(data) \\n                                                                   alert('transfer failed');\\n                                                                \\n                                                );\\nJavaScript\\nThis places the first call on hold and adds a third connection to this contact. The first connection is the agent, and the second connection is the customer on hold. Again, confirm the state of your call using an agent snapshot.\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\nJavaScript\\nAt this point, destroying the agent connection puts the other parties in a conference call. The customer experiences whatever you configure in the queue transfer contact flow. If their call is waiting in the queue, they experience the customer hold flow.\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\n \\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\nJavaScript\\nConnecting to another agent (scenario 5)\\nScenario 5 is similar to scenario 4. It uses the same quick connect endpoints and adds a connection to an agent quick connect.\\nHowever, if the destination agent is not available and you must make a cold transfer, the customer is disconnected, thanks to the transfer to agent block in the contact flow.\\nAmazon Connect Transfer to Agent Contact Flow Block\\nTo deal with this situation, coach your agents as follows: For cold transfers to other agents, they must wait for the destination agent to connect before completing the cold transfer.\\nIf that is not possible, one way to solve for this scenario could be by adopting the following workaround:\\nCreate a Queue transfer contact flow and set the working queue of the desired agent destination.\\nQueue Transfer Contact low\\nCreate a Queue quick connect called ColdXferSales02. Assign the contact flow to this quick connect.\\nAdd the ColdXferSales02 quick connect to the queue tied to the agent using the routing profile.\\nWith this done, you can use the same solution described in scenario 4 for this cold transfer to an agent. If the agent is unavailable, the customer waits in the queue until that agent becomes available. Make certain that you have the following procedure in place in case an agent is unavailable:\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber('+1xxxxxxxxxx'),);\\nJavaScript\\nUse an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected:\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\nJavaScript\\nYou can view all quick connect endpoints for this agent:\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)console.log(data.endpoints);,failure:function());\\nJavaScript\\nFor this example, assume that the quick connect index for the desired queue is 9:\\nVar quick;\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)quick=data.endpoints[9];,failure:function());\\n \\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(quick, \\n                                                            success: function(data) \\n                                                              alert('transfer success');\\n                                                           ,\\n                                                           failure: function(data) \\n                                                              alert('transfer failed');\\n                                                           \\n                                            );\\nJavaScript\\nThis places the first call on hold and adds a third connection to this contact. Confirm that the third connection connected with an agent snapshot:\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\nJavaScript\\nDestroying the agent connection at this point puts the other parties in a conference call. The customer experiences whatever you configure in the queue transfer contact flow or the customer hold flow if their call is waiting in the queue.\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\n \\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\nJavaScript\\nConclusion\\nIn this post, you learned how to implement cold transfers using the Amazon Connect Streams API. The Streams API methods described in this post enable your agents to transfer calls quickly to other destinations and move on to servicing their next customer.\\nYou can use the built-in warm transfer capabilities of Amazon Connect for high-touch customers and intricate issues that require passing along caller context and making introductions. In other cases, your agents can quickly transfer the calls and move on to the next interactions in the queue.\\nTest these scenarios with the developer tools of your preferred supported browser. Paste the code in this post in the browser console for quick validation, or make it part of your production implementation. To learn more, see Getting Started with Amazon Connect.

To edit queue settings, on the navigation menu choose Routing, Queues, and then choose the queue you want to edit.\\nThe following image shows an Edit queue page with an arrow pointing to the Outbound caller ID name and Outbound caller ID number.\\nOutbound caller ID name\\nThe Outbound caller ID name is set to the value that is passed from the SIP header. For example, Alice<sip:alice@example.com>.\\nImportant\\nAmazon Connect runs on a SIP-only infrastructure through our carrier partners. However, the caller ID name can be delivered to your customers only if the call path across the public telephony network is all on SIP. Because your customers are on many different networks outside of what Amazon Connect controls, the caller ID name is not guaranteed to be delivered to your customers. Depending on the country this will be up to 75% effective.\\nTo guarantee your caller ID name is delivered to customers, see Optimize your reputation for outbound calling for information about achieving it by using partner solutions.\\nOutbound caller ID number\\nOnly phone numbers that you've claimed or ported to Amazon Connect can be used as your caller ID number. Outbound calls without proper identification may be blocked in certain countries such as UK and Australia.\\nTo use an external phone number as your outbound caller ID number, contact AWS Support to see if it's possible. The phone number needs to be in a country we support for custom caller ID and you'll need to provide proof of ownership.\\nYou can set the caller ID number as follows:\\nCall phone number block: Use this block in an Outbound whisper flow to initiate an outbound call to a customer and, optionally, specify a custom caller ID number that is displayed to call recipients.\\nThis block is useful when you have multiple telephone numbers used to make outbound calls, but want to consistently display the same company phone number for the caller ID for calls made from your contact center.\\nYou can also use this block with the Set contact attributes block to set the callback number dynamically. For example, you can display a certain caller ID number based on the customer's account type.\\nQueue: If no caller ID number is specified in the Call phone number block, then the caller ID in the queue settings is used.\\nImportant\\nTelecoms regulation limit the telephone numbers that can be used to make outbound calls in various countries. If you have set up a new number and you are not able to make outbound calls, it may be because you have configured a number that is not permitted to make outbound calls. Check our Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide and Region requirements for ordering and porting phone numbers.\\nTelecom regulations in certain countries require the carrier to identify the caller. Therefore, any unidentifiable outbound calls will be blocked. Make sure you set the Caller ID in your configurations to avoid call failures.\\nToll-free numbers for caller ID\\nUsing toll-free numbers for outbound communications have a number of limitations. For example, using a toll-free number to dial other toll-free numbers in the United States can result in the number being filtered, blocked, or not properly routed to the destination by carriers. Toll-free numbers may be terminated at a higher than expected rate. If you know you need to call toll-free numbers in the United States you must use DIDs to make the calls to be guaranteed call delivery.\\nIf you're using toll-free numbers outside of the US, refer to the Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide to see which countries support toll-free numbers as outbound. For example, for Australia the guide shows it's not permitted to use toll-free numbers due to local regulations; the National Outbound column indicates that toll-free numbers are not supported.\\nImportant\\nToll-free products are designed to be national products and phoned within the country. We do not guarantee international reachability of any of these services as access to the numbers is controlled by the caller's network access.\\nHow to set the caller ID number dynamically\\nUse an attribute in the Call phone number block to set the caller ID number dynamically during the flow.\\nThe attribute can be one you define in the Set contact attributes block in the flow. Or, it can be an external attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function.\\nThe value of the attribute must be a phone number from your instance in E.164 format.\\nIf the number is not in E.164 format, the number from the queue associated with the Outbound whisper flow is used for the caller ID number.\\nIf no number is set for the outbound caller ID number for the queue, the call attempt will fail.\\nFor more information about setting the caller ID dynamically, see this AWS Support Knowledge Center article: How can I set my Amazon Connect outbound caller ID dynamically based on country?\\nUse E.164 format for international phone numbers\\nAmazon Connect requires phone numbers in E.164 format.\\nTo express a US phone number in E.164 format, add the '+' prefix and the country code in front of the number. For example, for a US number:\\n+1-800-555-1212\\nIn the UK and many other countries internationally, local dialing requires the addition of a 0 in front of the subscriber number. However, to use E.164 formatting, this 0 must be removed. A number such as 020 718 xxxxx in the UK would be formatted as +44 20 718 xxxxx. When you place calls from the CCP using Amazon Connect the CCP provides the correct formatting for numbers automatically.\\nImportant\\nPhone numbers that are not formatted in E.164 will not work. They will also result in a breach of Amazon Connect Service Terms and conditions for acceptable use which may result in your service being suspended.\\nHow to specify a custom caller ID number using a Call phone number block\\nOn the left navigation menu, choose Routing, Flows.\\nChoose the down arrow next to Create flow, and then choose Create outbound whisper flow.\\nAdd a Call phone number block to the flow, and connect the Entry point block to it.\\nThe Call phone number block must be placed before a Play prompt block if one is included in your flow.\\nSelect the Call phone number block, and then select Caller ID number to display.\\nDo one of the following:\\nTo use a number from your instance, choose Select a number from your instance, and then search for or select the number to use from the drop-down.\\nChoose Use attribute to use a contact attribute to provide the value for the caller ID number. You can use either a User Defined attribute you create using a Set contact attributes block, or an External attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function. The value of any attribute you use must be a phone number claimed for your instance and be in E.164 format. If the number used from an attribute is not in E.164 format, the number set for the Outbound caller ID number for the queue is used.\\nImportant\\nThe value of any attribute you use must be a phone number claimed for your instance. The number must be in E.164 format. If the number used from an attribute is not in E.164 format, calls may be terminated by the destination networks.\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure the numbers you are using are legally permissible. Certain numbers, such as +44870 numbers in the UK, are not legally permissible. You must ensure you're not using them.\\nAdd any additional blocks to complete your flow, and connect the Success branch of the Call phone number block to the next block in the flow.\\nThere is no error branch for the block. If a call is not successfully initiated, the flow ends and the agent is placed in an AfterContactWork (ACW) state.\\nCNAM\\nAs part of changes within the US Public Telephone network and a move to alternative reputation mechanisms described in Optimize your reputation for outbound calling, as of March 31, 2023, Amazon Connect no longer sets CNAM configurations.\\nWe conducted research between January and March 2023, that showed CNAM was seen by fewer than 7% of users. This is due to changes within support for mobile providers and due to the migration to app-based reputation mechanisms.\\nAll existing CNAM configurations set up before March 2023, are still in place. We will continue to focus on supporting modern replacement mechanisms added to our marketplace, for example, First Orion and Neustar.\\nHow to avoid labels like 'spam' and 'telemarketer'\\nSee the recommended steps in Optimize your reputation for outbound calling.\\n\\nBased on the above articles, answer briefly and concisely the following question:\\n\\nDoes Amazon Connect natively support SIP Trunk?\\n\\nGet your answer only from the articles, whitout making up new information.

Contact center supervisors\\\\nmake the most of that time by reducing the average handle time of interactions, so that agents can\\\\nquickly address customer issues and move on to the next interaction.\\\\nThis approach has a broader impact on contact center key performance indicators such as the average\\\\nspeed of answer, average hold times, abandoned rates, etc. Supervisors must maintain a fine balance of\\\\nensuring high customer satisfaction and reducing the time it takes to address customer issues. At times,\\\\nagents must consult other parties to solve customer issues. Those other parties could involve external\\\\nvendors, internal colleagues, or supervisors.\\\\nAmazon Connect natively supports warm transfers, which involve putting the customer on hold as the\\\\nagent makes an introduction about the caller to another party. Then, the agent can conference all\\\\nparties together and pass the context of the call for a seamless customer experience. The agent can then\\\\nleave this interaction, and the other parties stay connected. This approach works great for high-touch\\\\ncustomer experiences.\\\\nHowever, some calls don\\\\u2019t need their context passed on to the receiving party. Agents and supervisors\\\\nwant to quickly transfer these calls and move on to the next interaction. This is also known as a cold\\\\ntransfer. In this post, I demonstrate cold transfers using the Amazon Connect Streams API. For more\\\\ninformation about customizing the contact control panel (CCP), see the Streams API GitHub repository.\\\\nThis post discusses the following cold transfer scenarios. In the first three scenarios, the agent is\\\\nconnecting multiple external parties. In the fourth and fifth scenarios, the agent is connecting an\\\\nexternal party to another queue or agent.\\\\nThe agent makes an outbound call and then makes another outbound call. The agent cold\\\\ntransfers the first call to the second call.\\\\nThe agent receives an incoming call and then makes an outbound call.

That contact\\\\nobject initially possesses two connections:\\\\nThe agent connection to the Connect instance\\\\nThe calling or called party.\\\\nWhen the agent makes another phone call to an external number or quick connects, Amazon Connect creates a new connection and adds it to the same contact object. Except for cold transfers to agent quick connects, the agent connection can then safely disconnect and the remaining two parties remain conferenced automatically. For a cold transfer to agent quick connects, the destination agent must accept the phone call. Otherwise, the call fails. In this post, I review a workaround.\\\\nSolution\\\\nIn a production environment, you can implement these API calls in a custom CCP. However, if you are looking for quick validation, you can also make these API calls directly from the console in the Developer Tools section of Amazon Connect supported browsers.\\\\nPrerequisites\\\\nBefore getting started with this walk through, you need the following resources in place:\\\\nAn AWS account\\\\nAmazon Connect Instance\\\\nA configured Amazon Connect contact center and agents\\\\n(Optional) Quick Connects for external, agents and queue transfers\\\\n(Optional) A Custom CCP\\\\nWhitelisted Integrated Application\\\\nConnecting multiple external parties (scenarios 1\\\\u20133)\\\\nFor scenarios 1 through 3\\\\u2014where both parties are external, the solution is similar. The connection type differs if it is an inbound or outbound call, but connection type has no bearing on implementing cold transfers.\\\\nUse the Streams API to make the first outbound call:\\\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber('+1xxxxxxxxxx'),);\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nReplace the phone number \\\\u201c+1xxxxxxxxxx\\\\u201d with an actual destination phone number.\\\\nYou can use an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAgent Snapshot\\\\nCreate another endpoint of the type phone number.

Replace the phone number \\\\u201c+1xxxxxxxxxx\\\\u201d with an actual destination phone number.\\\\nvar endpoint = connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber('+1xxxxxxxxxx');\\\\n \\\\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(endpoint, \\\\n                                                                success: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert('transfer success');\\\\n                                                                ,\\\\n                                                                failure: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert('transfer failed');\\\\n                                                                \\\\n                                                );\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nYou can use the agent snapshot again to verify that the third connection is connected.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAfter that, obtain the agent connection of this contact object and destroy it.\\\\nYou can copy the contact object from the agent snapshot, or obtain it explicitly using the following method:\\\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\\\n \\\\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nThis completes the cold transfer to external numbers, either through quick connect for external transfer or agent manually dialed the number.\\\\nConnecting to another queue (scenario 4)\\\\nIn Scenario 4, the agent makes an outbound call or receives an incoming call, and then cold transfers it to another queue using queue quick connect.\\\\nUse the Streams API to make the first outbound call:\\\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber('+1xxxxxxxxxx'),);\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAt this time, you can use an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nYou can quickly view all the quick connect endpoints for this agent:\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)console.log(data.endpoints);,failure:function());\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nFor this example, assume that the quick connect index for desired queue is 9:\\\\nVar quick;\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)quick=data.endpoints[9];,failure:function());\\\\n \\\\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(quick, \\\\n                                                                success: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert('transfer success');\\\\n                                                                ,\\\\n                                                                failure: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert('transfer failed');\\\\n                                                                \\\\n                                                );\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nThis places the first call on hold and adds a third connection to this contact. The first connection is the agent, and the second connection is the customer on hold. Again, confirm the state of your call using an agent snapshot.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAt this point, destroying the agent connection puts the other parties in a conference call. The customer experiences whatever you configure in the queue transfer contact flow. If their call is waiting in the queue, they experience the customer hold flow.\\\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\\\n \\\\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nConnecting to another agent (scenario 5)\\\\nScenario 5 is similar to scenario 4. It uses the same quick connect endpoints and adds a connection to an agent quick connect.\\\\nHowever, if the destination agent is not available and you must make a cold transfer, the customer is disconnected, thanks to the transfer to agent block in the contact flow.\\\\nAmazon Connect Transfer to Agent Contact Flow Block\\\\nTo deal with this situation, coach your agents as follows: For cold transfers to other agents, they must wait for the destination agent to connect before completing the cold transfer.\\\\nIf that is not possible, one way to solve for this scenario could be by adopting the following workaround:\\\\nCreate a Queue transfer contact flow and set the working queue of the desired agent destination.\\\\nQueue Transfer Contact low\\\\nCreate a Queue quick connect called ColdXferSales02. Assign the contact flow to this quick connect.\\\\nAdd the ColdXferSales02 quick connect to the queue tied to the agent using the routing profile.\\\\nWith this done, you can use the same solution described in scenario 4 for this cold transfer to an agent. If the agent is unavailable, the customer waits in the queue until that agent becomes available. Make certain that you have the following procedure in place in case an agent is unavailable:\\\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber('+1xxxxxxxxxx'),);\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nUse an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected:\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nYou can view all quick connect endpoints for this agent:\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)console.log(data.endpoints);,failure:function());\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nFor this example, assume that the quick connect index for the desired queue is 9:\\\\nVar quick;\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)quick=data.endpoints[9];,failure:function());\\\\n \\\\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(quick, \\\\n                                                            success: function(data) \\\\n                                                              alert('transfer success');\\\\n                                                           ,\\\\n                                                           failure: function(data) \\\\n                                                              alert('transfer failed');\\\\n                                                           \\\\n                                            );\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nThis places the first call on hold and adds a third connection to this contact. Confirm that the third connection connected with an agent snapshot:\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nDestroying the agent connection at this point puts the other parties in a conference call. The customer experiences whatever you configure in the queue transfer contact flow or the customer hold flow if their call is waiting in the queue.\\\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\\\n \\\\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nConclusion\\\\nIn this post, you learned how to implement cold transfers using the Amazon Connect Streams API. The Streams API methods described in this post enable your agents to transfer calls quickly to other destinations and move on to servicing their next customer.\\\\nYou can use the built-in warm transfer capabilities of Amazon Connect for high-touch customers and intricate issues that require passing along caller context and making introductions. In other cases, your agents can quickly transfer the calls and move on to the next interactions in the queue.\\\\nTest these scenarios with the developer tools of your preferred supported browser. Paste the code in this post in the browser console for quick validation, or make it part of your production implementation. To learn more, see Getting Started with Amazon Connect.

To edit queue settings, on the navigation menu choose Routing, Queues, and then choose the queue you want to edit.\\\\nThe following image shows an Edit queue page with an arrow pointing to the Outbound caller ID name and Outbound caller ID number.\\\\nOutbound caller ID name\\\\nThe Outbound caller ID name is set to the value that is passed from the SIP header. For example, Alice<sip:alice@example.com>.\\\\nImportant\\\\nAmazon Connect runs on a SIP-only infrastructure through our carrier partners. However, the caller ID name can be delivered to your customers only if the call path across the public telephony network is all on SIP. Because your customers are on many different networks outside of what Amazon Connect controls, the caller ID name is not guaranteed to be delivered to your customers. Depending on the country this will be up to 75% effective.\\\\nTo guarantee your caller ID name is delivered to customers, see Optimize your reputation for outbound calling for information about achieving it by using partner solutions.\\\\nOutbound caller ID number\\\\nOnly phone numbers that you've claimed or ported to Amazon Connect can be used as your caller ID number. Outbound calls without proper identification may be blocked in certain countries such as UK and Australia.\\\\nTo use an external phone number as your outbound caller ID number, contact AWS Support to see if it's possible. The phone number needs to be in a country we support for custom caller ID and you'll need to provide proof of ownership.\\\\nYou can set the caller ID number as follows:\\\\nCall phone number block: Use this block in an Outbound whisper flow to initiate an outbound call to a customer and, optionally, specify a custom caller ID number that is displayed to call recipients.\\\\nThis block is useful when you have multiple telephone numbers used to make outbound calls, but want to consistently display the same company phone number for the caller ID for calls made from your contact center.\\\\nYou can also use this block with the Set contact attributes block to set the callback number dynamically. For example, you can display a certain caller ID number based on the customer's account type.\\\\nQueue: If no caller ID number is specified in the Call phone number block, then the caller ID in the queue settings is used.\\\\nImportant\\\\nTelecoms regulation limit the telephone numbers that can be used to make outbound calls in various countries. If you have set up a new number and you are not able to make outbound calls, it may be because you have configured a number that is not permitted to make outbound calls. Check our Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide and Region requirements for ordering and porting phone numbers.\\\\nTelecom regulations in certain countries require the carrier to identify the caller. Therefore, any unidentifiable outbound calls will be blocked. Make sure you set the Caller ID in your configurations to avoid call failures.\\\\nToll-free numbers for caller ID\\\\nUsing toll-free numbers for outbound communications have a number of limitations. For example, using a toll-free number to dial other toll-free numbers in the United States can result in the number being filtered, blocked, or not properly routed to the destination by carriers. Toll-free numbers may be terminated at a higher than expected rate. If you know you need to call toll-free numbers in the United States you must use DIDs to make the calls to be guaranteed call delivery.\\\\nIf you're using toll-free numbers outside of the US, refer to the Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide to see which countries support toll-free numbers as outbound. For example, for Australia the guide shows it's not permitted to use toll-free numbers due to local regulations; the National Outbound column indicates that toll-free numbers are not supported.\\\\nImportant\\\\nToll-free products are designed to be national products and phoned within the country. We do not guarantee international reachability of any of these services as access to the numbers is controlled by the caller's network access.\\\\nHow to set the caller ID number dynamically\\\\nUse an attribute in the Call phone number block to set the caller ID number dynamically during the flow.\\\\nThe attribute can be one you define in the Set contact attributes block in the flow. Or, it can be an external attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function.\\\\nThe value of the attribute must be a phone number from your instance in E.164 format.\\\\nIf the number is not in E.164 format, the number from the queue associated with the Outbound whisper flow is used for the caller ID number.\\\\nIf no number is set for the outbound caller ID number for the queue, the call attempt will fail.\\\\nFor more information about setting the caller ID dynamically, see this AWS Support Knowledge Center article: How can I set my Amazon Connect outbound caller ID dynamically based on country?\\\\nUse E.164 format for international phone numbers\\\\nAmazon Connect requires phone numbers in E.164 format.\\\\nTo express a US phone number in E.164 format, add the '+' prefix and the country code in front of the number. For example, for a US number:\\\\n+1-800-555-1212\\\\nIn the UK and many other countries internationally, local dialing requires the addition of a 0 in front of the subscriber number. However, to use E.164 formatting, this 0 must be removed. A number such as 020 718 xxxxx in the UK would be formatted as +44 20 718 xxxxx. When you place calls from the CCP using Amazon Connect the CCP provides the correct formatting for numbers automatically.\\\\nImportant\\\\nPhone numbers that are not formatted in E.164 will not work. They will also result in a breach of Amazon Connect Service Terms and conditions for acceptable use which may result in your service being suspended.\\\\nHow to specify a custom caller ID number using a Call phone number block\\\\nOn the left navigation menu, choose Routing, Flows.\\\\nChoose the down arrow next to Create flow, and then choose Create outbound whisper flow.\\\\nAdd a Call phone number block to the flow, and connect the Entry point block to it.\\\\nThe Call phone number block must be placed before a Play prompt block if one is included in your flow.\\\\nSelect the Call phone number block, and then select Caller ID number to display.\\\\nDo one of the following:\\\\nTo use a number from your instance, choose Select a number from your instance, and then search for or select the number to use from the drop-down.\\\\nChoose Use attribute to use a contact attribute to provide the value for the caller ID number. You can use either a User Defined attribute you create using a Set contact attributes block, or an External attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function. The value of any attribute you use must be a phone number claimed for your instance and be in E.164 format. If the number used from an attribute is not in E.164 format, the number set for the Outbound caller ID number for the queue is used.\\\\nImportant\\\\nThe value of any attribute you use must be a phone number claimed for your instance. The number must be in E.164 format. If the number used from an attribute is not in E.164 format, calls may be terminated by the destination networks.\\\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure the numbers you are using are legally permissible. Certain numbers, such as +44870 numbers in the UK, are not legally permissible. You must ensure you're not using them.\\\\nAdd any additional blocks to complete your flow, and connect the Success branch of the Call phone number block to the next block in the flow.\\\\nThere is no error branch for the block. If a call is not successfully initiated, the flow ends and the agent is placed in an AfterContactWork (ACW) state.\\\\nCNAM\\\\nAs part of changes within the US Public Telephone network and a move to alternative reputation mechanisms described in Optimize your reputation for outbound calling, as of March 31, 2023, Amazon Connect no longer sets CNAM configurations.\\\\nWe conducted research between January and March 2023, that showed CNAM was seen by fewer than 7% of users. This is due to changes within support for mobile providers and due to the migration to app-based reputation mechanisms.\\\\nAll existing CNAM configurations set up before March 2023, are still in place. We will continue to focus on supporting modern replacement mechanisms added to our marketplace, for example, First Orion and Neustar.\\\\nHow to avoid labels like 'spam' and 'telemarketer'\\\\nSee the recommended steps in Optimize your reputation for outbound calling.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the above articles, answer briefly and concisely the following question:\\\\n\\\\nDoes Amazon Connect natively support SIP Trunk?\\\\n\\\\nGet your answer only from the articles, whitout making up new information.

At times,\\\\nagents must consult other parties to solve customer issues. Those other parties could involve external\\\\nvendors, internal colleagues, or supervisors.\\\\nAmazon Connect natively supports warm transfers, which involve putting the customer on hold as the\\\\nagent makes an introduction about the caller to another party. Then, the agent can conference all\\\\nparties together and pass the context of the call for a seamless customer experience. The agent can then\\\\nleave this interaction, and the other parties stay connected. This approach works great for high-touch\\\\ncustomer experiences.\\\\nHowever, some calls don\\\\u2019t need their context passed on to the receiving party. Agents and supervisors\\\\nwant to quickly transfer these calls and move on to the next interaction. This is also known as a cold\\\\ntransfer. In this post, I demonstrate cold transfers using the Amazon Connect Streams API. For more\\\\ninformation about customizing the contact control panel (CCP), see the Streams API GitHub repository.\\\\nThis post discusses the following cold transfer scenarios. In the first three scenarios, the agent is\\\\nconnecting multiple external parties. In the fourth and fifth scenarios, the agent is connecting an\\\\nexternal party to another queue or agent.\\\\nThe agent makes an outbound call and then makes another outbound call. The agent cold\\\\ntransfers the first call to the second call.\\\\nThe agent receives an incoming call and then makes an outbound call. The agent cold transfers\\\\nthe first inbound call to the second outbound call.\\\\nThe agent receives an incoming call, then cold transfers that call to the external number using\\\\nquick connect.\\\\nThe agent receives an incoming call or makes an outbound call, then cold transfers that call to\\\\nanother queue using quick connects.\\\\nThe agent receives an incoming call or makes an outbound call, then cold transfers that call to\\\\nanother agent using quick connects.\\\\nBackground\\\\nWhen an agent makes or receives a phone call, Amazon Connect creates a contact object. That contact\\\\nobject initially possesses two connections:\\\\nThe agent connection to the Connect instance\\\\nThe calling or called party.\\\\nWhen the agent makes another phone call to an external number or quick connects, Amazon Connect creates a new connection and adds it to the same contact object. Except for cold transfers to agent quick connects, the agent connection can then safely disconnect and the remaining two parties remain conferenced automatically. For a cold transfer to agent quick connects, the destination agent must accept the phone call. Otherwise, the call fails. In this post, I review a workaround.\\\\nSolution\\\\nIn a production environment, you can implement these API calls in a custom CCP. However, if you are looking for quick validation, you can also make these API calls directly from the console in the Developer Tools section of Amazon Connect supported browsers.\\\\nPrerequisites\\\\nBefore getting started with this walk through, you need the following resources in place:\\\\nAn AWS account\\\\nAmazon Connect Instance\\\\nA configured Amazon Connect contact center and agents\\\\n(Optional) Quick Connects for external, agents and queue transfers\\\\n(Optional) A Custom CCP\\\\nWhitelisted Integrated Application\\\\nConnecting multiple external parties (scenarios 1\\\\u20133)\\\\nFor scenarios 1 through 3\\\\u2014where both parties are external, the solution is similar. The connection type differs if it is an inbound or outbound call, but connection type has no bearing on implementing cold transfers.\\\\nUse the Streams API to make the first outbound call:\\\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber(\\'+1xxxxxxxxxx\\'),);\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nReplace the phone number \\\\u201c+1xxxxxxxxxx\\\\u201d with an actual destination phone number.\\\\nYou can use an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAgent Snapshot\\\\nCreate another endpoint of the type phone number. Add a connection to that endpoint. This puts the first call on hold and initiates a connection to a second destination. Replace the phone number \\\\u201c+1xxxxxxxxxx\\\\u201d with an actual destination phone number.\\\\nvar endpoint = connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber(\\'+1xxxxxxxxxx\\');\\\\n \\\\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(endpoint, \\\\n                                                                success: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert(\\'transfer success\\');\\\\n                                                                ,\\\\n                                                                failure: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert(\\'transfer failed\\');\\\\n                                                                \\\\n                                                );\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nYou can use the agent snapshot again to verify that the third connection is connected.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAfter that, obtain the agent connection of this contact object and destroy it.\\\\nYou can copy the contact object from the agent snapshot, or obtain it explicitly using the following method:\\\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\\\n \\\\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nThis completes the cold transfer to external numbers, either through quick connect for external transfer or agent manually dialed the number.\\\\nConnecting to another queue (scenario 4)\\\\nIn Scenario 4, the agent makes an outbound call or receives an incoming call, and then cold transfers it to another queue using queue quick connect.\\\\nUse the Streams API to make the first outbound call:\\\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber(\\'+1xxxxxxxxxx\\'),);\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAt this time, you can use an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nYou can quickly view all the quick connect endpoints for this agent:\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)console.log(data.endpoints);,failure:function());\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nFor this example, assume that the quick connect index for desired queue is 9:\\\\nVar quick;\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)quick=data.endpoints[9];,failure:function());\\\\n \\\\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(quick, \\\\n                                                                success: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert(\\'transfer success\\');\\\\n                                                                ,\\\\n                                                                failure: function(data) \\\\n                                                                   alert(\\'transfer failed\\');\\\\n                                                                \\\\n                                                );\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nThis places the first call on hold and adds a third connection to this contact. The first connection is the agent, and the second connection is the customer on hold. Again, confirm the state of your call using an agent snapshot.\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nAt this point, destroying the agent connection puts the other parties in a conference call. The customer experiences whatever you configure in the queue transfer contact flow. If their call is waiting in the queue, they experience the customer hold flow.\\\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\\\n \\\\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nConnecting to another agent (scenario 5)\\\\nScenario 5 is similar to scenario 4. It uses the same quick connect endpoints and adds a connection to an agent quick connect.\\\\nHowever, if the destination agent is not available and you must make a cold transfer, the customer is disconnected, thanks to the transfer to agent block in the contact flow.\\\\nAmazon Connect Transfer to Agent Contact Flow Block\\\\nTo deal with this situation, coach your agents as follows: For cold transfers to other agents, they must wait for the destination agent to connect before completing the cold transfer.\\\\nIf that is not possible, one way to solve for this scenario could be by adopting the following workaround:\\\\nCreate a Queue transfer contact flow and set the working queue of the desired agent destination.\\\\nQueue Transfer Contact low\\\\nCreate a Queue quick connect called ColdXferSales02. Assign the contact flow to this quick connect.\\\\nAdd the ColdXferSales02 quick connect to the queue tied to the agent using the routing profile.\\\\nWith this done, you can use the same solution described in scenario 4 for this cold transfer to an agent. If the agent is unavailable, the customer waits in the queue until that agent becomes available. Make certain that you have the following procedure in place in case an agent is unavailable:\\\\nvar agent = new lily.Agent();\\\\nagent.connect(connect.Endpoint.byPhoneNumber(\\'+1xxxxxxxxxx\\'),);\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nUse an agent snapshot to confirm that both connections for that contact successfully connected:\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nYou can view all quick connect endpoints for this agent:\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)console.log(data.endpoints);,failure:function());\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nFor this example, assume that the quick connect index for the desired queue is 9:\\\\nVar quick;\\\\nagent.getEndpoints(agent.getAllQueueARNs(),success: function(data)quick=data.endpoints[9];,failure:function());\\\\n \\\\nagent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0].addConnection(quick, \\\\n                                                            success: function(data) \\\\n                                                              alert(\\'transfer success\\');\\\\n                                                           ,\\\\n                                                           failure: function(data) \\\\n                                                              alert(\\'transfer failed\\');\\\\n                                                           \\\\n                                            );\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nThis places the first call on hold and adds a third connection to this contact. Confirm that the third connection connected with an agent snapshot:\\\\nagent.toSnapshot();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nDestroying the agent connection at this point puts the other parties in a conference call. The customer experiences whatever you configure in the queue transfer contact flow or the customer hold flow if their call is waiting in the queue.\\\\nvar contact = agent.getContacts(lily.ContactType.VOICE)[0]\\\\n \\\\ncontact.getAgentConnection().destroy();\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nConclusion\\\\nIn this post, you learned how to implement cold transfers using the Amazon Connect Streams API. The Streams API methods described in this post enable your agents to transfer calls quickly to other destinations and move on to servicing their next customer.\\\\nYou can use the built-in warm transfer capabilities of Amazon Connect for high-touch customers and intricate issues that require passing along caller context and making introductions. In other cases, your agents can quickly transfer the calls and move on to the next interactions in the queue.\\\\nTest these scenarios with the developer tools of your preferred supported browser. Paste the code in this post in the browser console for quick validation, or make it part of your production implementation. To learn more, see Getting Started with Amazon Connect. To learn about other exposed event subscription methods and action methods exposed, see the Amazon Connect Streams API documentation.\\\\nArticle 2:\\\\n\\\\nSet up outbound caller ID\\\\n\\\\nThis topic explains how to set up your outbound caller ID name and number.\\\\nContents\\\\nOutbound parameters: Set in queue\\\\nHow to set the caller ID number dynamically\\\\nUse E.164 format for international phone numbers\\\\nHow to specify a custom caller ID number using a block\\\\nCNAM\\\\nAvoid labels like \\'spam\\'\\\\nOutbound parameters: Set in queue\\\\nYou set the outbound caller ID name (such as the name of your company) and caller ID number in the queue settings. To edit queue settings, on the navigation menu choose Routing, Queues, and then choose the queue you want to edit.\\\\nThe following image shows an Edit queue page with an arrow pointing to the Outbound caller ID name and Outbound caller ID number.\\\\nOutbound caller ID name\\\\nThe Outbound caller ID name is set to the value that is passed from the SIP header. For example, Alice<sip:alice@example.com>.\\\\nImportant\\\\nAmazon Connect runs on a SIP-only infrastructure through our carrier partners. However, the caller ID name can be delivered to your customers only if the call path across the public telephony network is all on SIP. Because your customers are on many different networks outside of what Amazon Connect controls, the caller ID name is not guaranteed to be delivered to your customers. Depending on the country this will be up to 75% effective.\\\\nTo guarantee your caller ID name is delivered to customers, see Optimize your reputation for outbound calling for information about achieving it by using partner solutions.\\\\nOutbound caller ID number\\\\nOnly phone numbers that you\\'ve claimed or ported to Amazon Connect can be used as your caller ID number. Outbound calls without proper identification may be blocked in certain countries such as UK and Australia.\\\\nTo use an external phone number as your outbound caller ID number, contact AWS Support to see if it\\'s possible. The phone number needs to be in a country we support for custom caller ID and you\\'ll need to provide proof of ownership.\\\\nYou can set the caller ID number as follows:\\\\nCall phone number block: Use this block in an Outbound whisper flow to initiate an outbound call to a customer and, optionally, specify a custom caller ID number that is displayed to call recipients.\\\\nThis block is useful when you have multiple telephone numbers used to make outbound calls, but want to consistently display the same company phone number for the caller ID for calls made from your contact center.\\\\nYou can also use this block with the Set contact attributes block to set the callback number dynamically. For example, you can display a certain caller ID number based on the customer\\'s account type.\\\\nQueue: If no caller ID number is specified in the Call phone number block, then the caller ID in the queue settings is used.\\\\nImportant\\\\nTelecoms regulation limit the telephone numbers that can be used to make outbound calls in various countries. If you have set up a new number and you are not able to make outbound calls, it may be because you have configured a number that is not permitted to make outbound calls. Check our Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide and Region requirements for ordering and porting phone numbers.\\\\nTelecom regulations in certain countries require the carrier to identify the caller. Therefore, any unidentifiable outbound calls will be blocked. Make sure you set the Caller ID in your configurations to avoid call failures.\\\\nToll-free numbers for caller ID\\\\nUsing toll-free numbers for outbound communications have a number of limitations. For example, using a toll-free number to dial other toll-free numbers in the United States can result in the number being filtered, blocked, or not properly routed to the destination by carriers. Toll-free numbers may be terminated at a higher than expected rate. If you know you need to call toll-free numbers in the United States you must use DIDs to make the calls to be guaranteed call delivery.\\\\nIf you\\'re using toll-free numbers outside of the US, refer to the Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide to see which countries support toll-free numbers as outbound. For example, for Australia the guide shows it\\'s not permitted to use toll-free numbers due to local regulations; the National Outbound column indicates that toll-free numbers are not supported.\\\\nImportant\\\\nToll-free products are designed to be national products and phoned within the country. We do not guarantee international reachability of any of these services as access to the numbers is controlled by the caller\\'s network access.\\\\nHow to set the caller ID number dynamically\\\\nUse an attribute in the Call phone number block to set the caller ID number dynamically during the flow.\\\\nThe attribute can be one you define in the Set contact attributes block in the flow. Or, it can be an external attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function.\\\\nThe value of the attribute must be a phone number from your instance in E.164 format.\\\\nIf the number is not in E.164 format, the number from the queue associated with the Outbound whisper flow is used for the caller ID number.\\\\nIf no number is set for the outbound caller ID number for the queue, the call attempt will fail.\\\\nFor more information about setting the caller ID dynamically, see this AWS Support Knowledge Center article: How can I set my Amazon Connect outbound caller ID dynamically based on country?\\\\nUse E.164 format for international phone numbers\\\\nAmazon Connect requires phone numbers in E.164 format.\\\\nTo express a US phone number in E.164 format, add the \\'+\\' prefix and the country code in front of the number. For example, for a US number:\\\\n+1-800-555-1212\\\\nIn the UK and many other countries internationally, local dialing requires the addition of a 0 in front of the subscriber number. However, to use E.164 formatting, this 0 must be removed. A number such as 020 718 xxxxx in the UK would be formatted as +44 20 718 xxxxx. When you place calls from the CCP using Amazon Connect the CCP provides the correct formatting for numbers automatically.\\\\nImportant\\\\nPhone numbers that are not formatted in E.164 will not work. They will also result in a breach of Amazon Connect Service Terms and conditions for acceptable use which may result in your service being suspended.\\\\nHow to specify a custom caller ID number using a Call phone number block\\\\nOn the left navigation menu, choose Routing, Flows.\\\\nChoose the down arrow next to Create flow, and then choose Create outbound whisper flow.\\\\nAdd a Call phone number block to the flow, and connect the Entry point block to it.\\\\nThe Call phone number block must be placed before a Play prompt block if one is included in your flow.\\\\nSelect the Call phone number block, and then select Caller ID number to display.\\\\nDo one of the following:\\\\nTo use a number from your instance, choose Select a number from your instance, and then search for or select the number to use from the drop-down.\\\\nChoose Use attribute to use a contact attribute to provide the value for the caller ID number. You can use either a User Defined attribute you create using a Set contact attributes block, or an External attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function. The value of any attribute you use must be a phone number claimed for your instance and be in E.164 format. If the number used from an attribute is not in E.164 format, the number set for the Outbound caller ID number for the queue is used.\\\\nImportant\\\\nThe value of any attribute you use must be a phone number claimed for your instance. The number must be in E.164 format. If the number used from an attribute is not in E.164 format, calls may be terminated by the destination networks.\\\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure the numbers you are using are legally permissible. Certain numbers, such as +44870 numbers in the UK, are not legally permissible. You must ensure you\\'re not using them.\\\\nAdd any additional blocks to complete your flow, and connect the Success branch of the Call phone number block to the next block in the flow.\\\\nThere is no error branch for the block. If a call is not successfully initiated, the flow ends and the agent is placed in an AfterContactWork (ACW) state.\\\\nCNAM\\\\nAs part of changes within the US Public Telephone network and a move to alternative reputation mechanisms described in Optimize your reputation for outbound calling, as of March 31, 2023, Amazon Connect no longer sets CNAM configurations.\\\\nWe conducted research between January and March 2023, that showed CNAM was seen by fewer than 7% of users. This is due to changes within support for mobile providers and due to the migration to app-based reputation mechanisms.\\\\nAll existing CNAM configurations set up before March 2023, are still in place. We will continue to focus on supporting modern replacement mechanisms added to our marketplace, for example, First Orion and Neustar.\\\\nHow to avoid labels like \\'spam\\' and \\'telemarketer\\'\\\\nSee the recommended steps in Optimize your reputation for outbound calling.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the above articles, answer briefly and concisely the following question:\\\\n\\\\nDoes Amazon Connect natively support SIP Trunk?\\\\n\\\\nGet your answer only from the articles, whitout making up new information.
