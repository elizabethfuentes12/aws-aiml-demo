    "  - _**Features:**_ Implements safeguards customized to specific use cases and responsible AI policies.\n",
    "  - _**Key Benefits:**_\n",
    "    - **Denied Topics:** Define topics to avoid using natural language descriptions.\n",
    "    - **Content Filters:** Set thresholds for filtering harmful content across categories like hate, insults, sexual, and violence.\n",
    "    - **PII Redaction (Upcoming):** Selectively redact personally identifiable information (PII) from responses.\n",
    "  - _**Integration:**_ Works with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and analysis, and can be applied to all large language models (LLMs) in Amazon Bedrock, including Amazon Titan Text, Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama 2, AI21 Jurassic, and Cohere Command.\n",
    "  - _**Application:**_ Allows for consistent AI safety across various applications and can be integrated with Agents for Amazon Bedrock.    \n",

    " Guardrails for LLMs act as control mechanisms to ensure that LLM generated responses remain within desired parameters, preventing and correcting unwanted content output. They are programmable to follow specified interaction paths, respond to certain user requests in particular ways, and maintain a designated language style, among other controls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have tried using System Messages to address some of the concerns mentioned earlier (e.g. \"You are a helpful and friendly bot...\"). While useful, Guardrails offer an even more powerful solution that goes beyond standard system prompts.\n",
    "Unlike basic system messages, Guardrails treat the LLM as a black box component, allowing for separate monitoring of inputs and outputs. This enables the LLM to focus solely on its core task, while the Guardrails framework handles conversation monitoring and safety.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Guardrails, you can implement much more advanced conversation policies, guidance, and safeguards. System messages are limited to simple statements, whereas Guardrails allow for robust input sanitization, output filtering, conversational flow control, and more.\n",
    "So in summary - system prompts are useful, but Guardrails take AI assistance to the next level in terms of capabilities and safety. Guardrails don't replace system messages, they expand upon them.  \n",

    "As you delve into experimenting with guardrails in this notebook, you'll discover how they contribute to the safety, reliability, and ethical handling of LLMs.    \n",

    "Topical rail ensures AI responses stay within the predefined topic, and prevents off-topic conversations that has no business value.\n",
    "1. As part of Guardrails configuration, you define different conversation flow and how Guardrails treat them.\n",
    "2. You provide example input texts for each flow.\n",
    "3. When the user sends text, Guardrails intercepts it, and tries to understand which flow it maps to (Embedding based similarity search vs each flow's examples texts). \n",
    "4. With the flow established Guardrails carries out the flow (e.g., let's the LLM respond, or replies back the conversation is off-topic)."

    "in the context of bots refers to a set of mechanisms or filters applied to ensure that the bot's responses and interactions remain appropriate, respectful, and free from offensive or harmful content.

    "## Conclusion and Wrap Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this module on establishing guardrails on chatbots and large language models! Guardrails for LLMs act as control mechanisms to ensure that LLM-generated responses remain within desired parameters, preventing and correcting unwanted content output. They are programmable to follow specified interaction paths, respond to certain user requests in particular ways, and maintain a designated language style, among other controls.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Designing guardrails before deploying chatbots and large language models to production should be a top priority during the early stages. Understanding how these guardrails function is crucial for enhancing your solutions and effectively positioning and configuring them. It's advisable to adopt and implement guardrails from the outset, ensuring the creation of secure and well-moderated language generation systems. Great job!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this demo, we used Amazon Bedrock, NeMo Guardrails, and Faiss to set guardrails on conversational bots and showcased the following applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jailbreaking Rail:** Restricts AI from deviating from a set response format.\n",
    "- **Topical Rail:** Ensures that chatbots stay on topic.\n",
    "- **Moderation Rail:** Moderates AI responses to maintain a neutral stance.\n",
